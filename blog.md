## About Me
Hi. My name is Ibrahim Shoukry and I'm currently attending a community college. I joined this hackathon in order to get experience and see what it's like to have a big programming project while also having some extracaricular acrivities to add when applying for universities. This hackathon looks very interesting and I'm very excited to be a part of it; and see what other participants come up with too.
